# Create Tables

## CREATE TABLE

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, age INTEGER);
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 id \( PRIMARY KEY\) of the table -- it identifies each row in the table and allows us to conveniently refer to any row.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
